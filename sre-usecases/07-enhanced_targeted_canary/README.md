# Getting Started

## Summary
Canary deployment is an S/W releasing technique to reduce the risk of introducing new features or a new version in production for the DevOps team. In our SRE demo series, we already introduced how our customers easily can release their new S/W version with minimum risk using the canary deployment model. You can find more details of 'SRE Canary Deployment' use-case in [here](sre-usecases/01-targeted-canary/README.md).
In this use-case, we've enhanced our existing canary deployment use-case with F5 APM(Access Policy Manager), NGINX+, Microsoft Azure AD, and Red Hat OpenShift. You can learn how F5 components help to apply canary deployment in your containerized environment in this demo.

## Prerequisites
- BIG-IP APM and NGINX+ already installed
- Microsoft Azure AD B2C enabled
