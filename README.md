# SRE Multi-Cluster Container Platform

## Summary
This Site Reliability Engineering (or SRE) Multi-Cluster design is an F5 Alliances product showcase. It is initiated by the F5 Business Development organization.

## Goal

The Purpose of the Multi-Cluster SRE demo is to show how the F5 product portfolio (BIG-IP, [Container Ingress Services](https://github.com/F5Networks/k8s-bigip-ctlr),  NGINX+, and F5 Cloud Service) can be used in conjunction with several other F5 Alliances integrations to help an SRE deploy, manage and secure modern applications.


The Multi-Cluster SRE Design can be used:
- as a self learning tool to get familiar with OpenShift, and F5 technologies (BIG-IP, Container Ingress Services, NGINX, and F5 Cloud service etc.) 
- to build demos and proof of concepts (POC's)


## Prerequisites
Although the respective requirements vary for each use case, in general you will need several prerequisites in place to begin.

- Subscribe to F5 Beacon [Click here](Beacon%20Subscription.pdf)
- Access to git preferable a valid GitHub account
  - https://github.com/
- A minimum of two OpenShift clusters
  - https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/
- Two Licensed BIG-IP VE appliances with Best licenses, one per cluster
  - https://f5.com/products/trials/product-trials/product-trial
- F5 Container Ingress Service - Installed
  - https://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v2/openshift/
- Access to F5 Cloud Services (DNS Load Balancing)
  - https://portal.cloudservices.f5.com/



## Getting started

Once the necessary infrastructure and services are in place users will be able to go to each use case directory under [*sre-usecases*](sre-usecases), and follow  **README** for detailed implementation.

The SRE demo will be centered around the following distinct customer driven use cases:


- [Scenario Use Case #1: Blue Green Deployment with F5 Cloud Services](./sre-usecases/02-blue-green-deployment/README.md)
- [Scenario Use Case #2: Targeted Canary Deployment](sre-usecases/01-targeted-canary/README.md)
- [Scenario Use Case #3: Observability with ELK](sre-usecases/03-observability-for-targeted-canary-with-ELKâ€©/README.md)
- [Scenario Use Case #4: Observability with Beacon](sre-usecases/04-observability-for-code-to-customer-with-Beacon/README.md)
- [Scenario Use Case #5: North-South Traffic Protection in the OpenShift Environment](sre-usecases/05-north_south_protection/README.md)
- [Scenario Use Case #6: Protecting Critical Apps against East-West Attack](sre-usecases/06-east_west_attack/README.md)
- [Scenario Use Case #7: Enhanced Targeted Canary Deployment](sre-usecases/07-enhanced_targeted_canary/README.md)

This project is WIP, with more use cases to be added.
